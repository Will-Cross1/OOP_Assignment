Python or Java?


Supplier Management:

Inventory Management:
-	Track and manage stock levels

Minimise runtime errors (assuming this will be scaled up) (python may be difficult to detect runtime errors) (type annotations?)

Have a very basic text-based UI
(USER INTERFACE MUST BE DECOUPLED FROM THE BUSINESS LOGIC)


Must include (and be documented) illustrating inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism


Use CASE development tools (Whatever that means)
