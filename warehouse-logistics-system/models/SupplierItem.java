 * Represents an item provided by a supplier, extending the base Item class with an additional

 * 
 * This class is used to store and manage details about items sourced from suppliers, including 
 * the item's price specific to the supplier. It extends the `Item` class to inherit basic 
 * item attributes such as ID, name, and description, while also introducing the `supplierPrice` 
 * attribute to represent the cost at which the supplier offers the item.
 * 
 * Provides methods for accessing and modifying the supplier price, as well as a formatted string 
 * representation of the item.
